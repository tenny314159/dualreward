In some situations, those who are physically attractive are more likely to receive aid.  For example  , in a field study researchers placed a completed application to graduate school in a telephone box at the airport. The application was ready to be  _  , but had apparently been \"lost\". The photo attached to the application was sometimes that of a very  _  person and sometimes that of a less attractive person. The measure of helping was whether the individual who found the envelope actually mailed it or not. Results showed that people were more likely to  send in  the application if the person in the photo was physically attractive. The degree of  _  between the potential helper and the person in need is also important. For example, people are more likely to help a stranger who is from the same country rather than a foreigner. In one study, shoppers on a busy street in Scotland were more likely to help a person wearing a(n)  _  T-shirt than a person wearing a T-shirt printed with offensive words.

She got her first lesson in story-telling from  _  grandfather, who gave her words of love. He set off her imagination and influenced her much. Meyer always had stories running  _  her head and as soon as she could write, she put them down on paper. Meye  _  remembered the call that changed her life. It was Tuesday, February 18 , when the  _  rang in the kitchen of her Los Angeles home. On the line was Marty Banderas, a literary agent to whom she had sent a copy of her novel three weeks earlier. She asked Meyer some  _  information, like age and health condition. Meyer felt  _  and asked what that was about. Banderas only replied, \"I've just sold your  _  for one and a half million dollars!\" She sat down in shock. She had written over fourteen novels in twenty years, but each one had been  _  by publishers . Many people would have been discouraged ,  _  not her. Each time, she just got down to writing another one. Her husband advised her to find something else to do, but she never  gave up  . Seeing this book published was the most  _  thing that has ever happened to her. Now she is a  _  of three children, but she has never stopped  _  , turning out novels between kids and dishes. She is writing another novel now, and she expects another success. Yes, her belief has brought her  _  , and it has changed her life  in return  . Meyer is very confident that she will enjoy a more successful and meaningful life as long as she keeps on with her dream.", "options": [["my", "your", "her", "his"], ["through", "with", "along", "across"], ["hardly", "probably", "clearly", "usually"], ["phone", "bell", "clock", "alarm"], ["local", "public", "personal", "national"], ["happy", "afraid", "sad", "strange"], ["painting", "novel", "newspaper", "magazine"], ["accepted", "agreed", "refused", "enjoyed"], ["so", "or", "and", "but"], ["boring", "tiring", "exciting", "interesting"], ["teacher", "cousin", "nurse", "mother"], ["writing", "reading", "listening", "speaking"], ["freedom", "success", "friendship", "beauty"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "C", "A", "C", "D", "B", "C", "D", "C", "D", "A", "B"], "source": "middle2524"}, {"article": "Summer is my favorite season.

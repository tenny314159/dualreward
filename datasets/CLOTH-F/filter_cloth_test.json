Language is our greatest treasure as a species, and what do we  _  do with it? We gossip. About others' behaviour and private lives, such as who's doing what with whom, who's in and who's out-and why; how to deal with difficult  _  situations involving children, lovers, and colleagues. So why are we keen on gossiping? Are we just natural  _  , of both time and words? Or do we talk a lot about nothing in particular simply to avoid facing up to the really important issues of life? It's not the case according to Professor Robin Dunbar. In fact, in his latest book, Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language, the psychologist says gossip is one of these really  _  issues. Dunbar  _  the traditional view that language was developed by the men at the early stage of social development in order to organize their manly hunting activities more effectively, or even to promote the exchange of poetic stories about their origins and the supernatural. Instead he suggests that language evolved among women. We don't spend two-thirds of our time gossiping just because we can talk, argues Dunbar--  on the contrary  , he goes on to say, language evolved specifically to allow us to gossip. Dunbar arrived at his cheery theory by studying the  _  of the higher primates like monkeys. By means of grooming--cleaning the fur by brushing it, monkeys form groups with other individuals on whom they can rely for support in the event of some kind of conflict within the group or  _  from outside it. As we human beings evolve from a particular branch of the primate family, Dunbar  _  that at one time in our history we did much the same. Grouping together made sense because the bigger the group, the greater the  _  it provided; on the other hand, the bigger the group, the greater the stresses of living close to others. Grooming helped to  _  the pressure and calm everybody down. But as the groups got bigger and bigger, the amount of time spent in grooming activities also had to be  _  to maintain its effectiveness.

In this heartwarming video, Carrickhoff stands outside her house in Oakridge, North Carolina,  _  for a deer she has named \"Little Girl.\" The deer comes out of the  _  and jumps on her. It hurries up the driveway and  _  Carrickhoff into the house, where it then sucks down a baby bottle of goat's milk. When the  _  is gone, Carrickhoff wipes its mouth with a tissue. While some animal lovers were touched by the obvious  _  Carrickhoff had with the deer, others felt she wasn't doing the deer any  _  . They said she was allowing the deer to get too  _  around humans and it could have been hit by a car, been shot by a hunter, or hurt someone. \"You just gave this animal a death  _  -- you also have put all your neighbors and their children at  _  of being attacked when this deer matures, and when it doesn't get  _  , it attacks someone,\" one reader wrote. Carrickhoff's comment was that if she had known the video would get so many  _  she would have changed out of her gym clothes. As for the deer,  _  , the update isn't a happy one. Little Girl continued coming back for bottles until around January 2011, when it moved onto  _  deer food, Carrickhoff said. \"She walked off into the woods and we never saw her again,\" she said. \"We  _  those woods ... we never found anything.\" Looking back, Carrickhoff said getting to know the deer was a special  _  that she wouldn't regret. Friends had brought Little Girl to Carrickhoff's home because the woods in their backyard were protected, and the deer would be  _  from hunters. School children loved visiting the gentle creature, who would  _  them with its soft tongue and didn't mind being  _  . Carrickhoff is confident that she didn't over-domesticate the animal. Even when Little Girl was bottle-fed, she lived in the woods and did \"deer things\", Carrickhoff's daughter said. The deer gave birth to a  _  of its own the following June, and toward the end, it wouldn't come when it was called. It was becoming  _  again.

The goal is not just to  _  lives, but to change the victims' lives. The Institute hopes some entrepreneurs might program and  _  some money with these ideas. One of the structures in the SMU village was built with bricks made  _  from recycled plastic bags. They're  _  together with heavy wires. Harvey Lacey, father of two college-aged sons, including one here at SUM, heard about this project and  _  his invention. It's a heavy-duty, hand-crank compactor that anybody can use to form the big bricks he calls Ubuntu Blox. \"The advantages are that these  _  weigh less than two pounds.

Kenyan  _  Ronald Omyonga, visiting the global village before returning to his native Africa, says his country is full of these recyclable bags. With Lacey's design, he says that litter could be transformed into  _  housing. He dreams of other  _  too. \"Look at the Harvey Lacey hut, as a means of creating  _  ,\"says Omyonga.\"Leaning the environment, and turning  _  into something that can form houses, not just for the poor.\"", "options": [["shelters", "clubs", "parties", "rooms"], ["affect", "adapt", "effect", "adopt"], ["discovered", "helped", "studied", "explored"], ["entry", "competition", "trade", "market"], ["save", "survive", "defend", "cure"], ["share", "donate", "earn", "cost"], ["briefly", "relevantly", "mostly", "efficiently"], ["held", "stressed", "knocked", "packed"], ["delivered", "contributed", "devoted", "sacrificed"], ["piles", "masses", "loaves", "blocks"], ["fragile", "thick", "hard", "bitter"], ["build", "invent", "improve", "possess"], ["hot", "cold", "wet", "cool"], ["nearly", "exactly", "partly", "fairly"], ["doctor", "athlete", "photographer", "architect"], ["safe", "dangerous", "beautiful", "large"], ["advantages", "chances", "benefits", "profits"], ["things", "jobs", "wonders", "conditions"], ["waste", "resources", "ideas", "technology"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "C", "A", "B", "D", "C", "A", "D", "C", "D", "A", "C", "B", "A"], "source": "high3877"}, {"article": "I had the meanest mother in the world.  _  other kids ate candy, I had to have cereal ,eggs or toast.While others had cakes and French fries,I had to eat a sandwich.But at least,I wasn't  _  in my suffering.My sisters and two brothers had the same mean mother as I did.

The following are more of the new rules. Tell the truth. Have you ever copied  someone else's  work in an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something  _  students should do. If you are playing computer games in your room, don't tell your parents you are doing homework. Do more activities at school. Good students love animals and  care for  others. April is Bird Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate it? You should join! That way you can learn more about animals and  how to protect  them. When more people work together, it brings us more  _  . Learn to co-operate. When your basketball team is  _  , only working together can make your team  stronger  . Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. Be open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll  discover  Earth II someday. Don't look down upon new ideas. All the ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone. Pay attention to your safety. You should not walk  _  outside, especially at night.  Make sure  where the public phones are. If  anything dangerous  happens, you can find them quickly. If you take a bus to a place far away, please don't sleep. This stops a stranger from  stealing  money from you. Use the Internet carefully.
